## Welcome to the Clicky Game!

Find the deployed version here - https://klbjklbj.github.io/ClickyGame/.

This project was made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It uses the NPM "shuffle-array" package which is a handy little tool for randomizing the array images when an image is clicked.

The goal of the game is to click as many images as you can without clicking one you've already clicked. See if you can click all 12 with no repeats. It's strangely addicting. :-)
